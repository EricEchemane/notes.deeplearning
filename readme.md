# Notes for Deep Learning

A big thanks to [codebasics](https://www.youtube.com/c/codebasics) for his [deep learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mubj_fqiAv8&list=PLeo1K3hjS3uu7CxAacxVndI4bE_o3BDtO
) playlist on youtube.

I curated my own notes for absolute learning. Here I created my own implementations of deep learning key functions and document them for understanding it deeply.

1. [What is a neuron?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mubj_fqiAv8&list=PLeo1K3hjS3uu7CxAacxVndI4bE_o3BDtO
)
A neuron is compose of a linear part and an activation part. The linear function receives an input x then passing it to the activation function. The activation function uses the input x and outputs only 2 values. For instance, x to either 0 or 1, *e.g sigmoid function*. Or, x to max(0,x) *e.g. ReLU function*.
